## Education Background

**China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)**    *Computer Science and Technology*   *September 2021 - May 2024*  
- Average GPA ranked 1/61 for the first five semesters

### Research Interests

#### Complex Network
Jiayu Ding serves as the leader of the project on Complex Network-based Urban Hazard Assessment. Traditional approaches to flood vulnerability assessment of transport systems often ignore the complex relationship between road network structure and ground structure. To address this problem, the project is based on complex network theory and Coupled the basic geographic data with the road network vector data and analysed them to establish a two-layer network assessment model. The experimental results of the model passed the waterlogging point test, revealing the correlation between the road network structure and the surface environment.

Jiayu Ding is the first author of the paper titled "A Dual-Layer Complex Network Based Quantitative Flood Vulnerability Assessment Method of Transportation System," which is published in a journal ranked Q2 by JCR, indexed by SCI and EI, and has an impact factor of 3.9.

#### 2D Image
Participated in the CBAS-Chinese University of Geosciences (Wuhan) Node Cultivation Project [Project No. CBAS2022GSP05], responsible for constructing high-quality semantic segmentation datasets. In the course of the project, we systematically learnt the models of unet, transunet, transformer, mamba, vit, etc., and proposed the Unet semantic segmentation framework incorporating the self-attention mechanism.

#### 3D Point Cloud
In the future, it will be engaged in research in the direction of 3d point cloud, especially in the direction of point cloud compression.
